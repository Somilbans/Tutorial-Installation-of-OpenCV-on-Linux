--------------------------------------------------

The most simple way to install a library is running an installation script.

Download the installation script install-opencv.sh, open your terminal and execute:

Run the command on terminal

bash install-opencv.sh

Type your sudo password and you will have installed OpenCV. This operation may take a long time due to the packages to be installed and the compilation process.
